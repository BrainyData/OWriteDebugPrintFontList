# OWrite Debug Print Font List

This debug library is used for producing three PDF files that list installed fonts in various ways for the purpose of investigating font related issues.

To build the library you will require the following external components by Brainy Data; OWrite and PDFDevice. If you do not have them, demo versions are available at https://www.brainydata.com/demos. Furthermore, additional files and libraries are required which can also be downloaded from the same location.
